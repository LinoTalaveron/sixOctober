            Dear Eileen,
            <br><br>
            Thank you for your recent application to <a href="http://example.com">join us</a> at the Faculty of Science at <a href="http://example.com">Université Génialissime</a> to<br>study for your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
            <br>
            <br>
            Start dates
            <br>
            <br>
            We are happy that you can start your studies with us at any time, but we prefer that you start at the<br> beginning of a semester; the start dates for each semester are as follows:
            <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: September 9, 2016</li><br>
            <li>Second semester: January 15, 2017</li><br>
            <li>hird semester: May 2, 2017</li><br><br>
        </ul>
            Please let me know if this is right for you, and if so, which start date you prefer.<br>
            You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
            <br><br>
            Study subjects
            <br><br>
            In the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research, as long as the subjects fall<br> within the field of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent and dedicated researcher, just the<br>kind of person we would like to have on our team. That said, among the ideas you submitted, the ones<br>that intrigued us the most are the following, in order of priority:<br>
            <br>
            Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).<br>
            Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30°C (86°F), when<br> audience size increases exponentially (effect from 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup> .)<br>
            Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.<br><br>

            Can you provide us with more information on each of these topics, including the expected duration of the<br> research, the staff and other resources needed, and anything else we should know? Thank you.<br><br>

            Please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments,<br><br><br>
